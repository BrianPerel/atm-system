# ATM
 Java ATM machine
-To use db through localhost use XAMPP (start apache and mysql)
-Make sure to go to phpmyadmin, select the database ('atm_database'), privileges, add user account, create a user with username = 'Brian' password = 'jkV2q]VNsmNnE!m' hostname = 'localhost' and give user all privileges

NOTE: Please comment out taskdef name="launch4j" in build.xml unless your going to create executables for the projects through ANT. In that case make sure to download (https://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/files/launch4j) and paste it into the root of the IDE workspace
